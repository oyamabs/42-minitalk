# minitalk

kill, kill, kill

# Goal

Make a small program allowing a client to communicate with a server

- Communication can *only* be made with UNIX signals
- We can only use `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`
- Communication should be as quick as possible
- Messages should not be cut or altered by the server

# Bonuses

I did the two bonuses
- The client and the server can handle unicode characters such as emojis
- Once recieved, the server sends back a signal to the client

# My thoughts on the project

That was ez ðŸ˜Ž.

Doing minitalk was really fun and made me learn a lot about UNIX signals. I had only a vague idea of how they worked but turns out they can be much more feature-complete than I thought.
